Question 1 How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?

We do that using the socket module's socket class to create a socket object

Question 2 What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?

Client socket connects to a listening server. Server socket is there to listen for a connection from the client while binding to a port.

Question 3 How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?

Using socket.SO_REUSEADDR in the setsockopt method for the socket object. e.g. s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Question 4 What information do we get about incoming connections?

We get the address, i.e. IP and Port, bound to the socket on the other end of the connection, i.e. ('127.0.0.1', 33598)

Question 5 What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?

The google homepage was returned in form of bytestring.
